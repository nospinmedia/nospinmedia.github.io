  <h1>Why We Use AI</h1>
  <p><strong>No Spin Media</strong> isn’t just a name — it’s a mission. And at the heart of that mission is a powerful new tool: artificial intelligence. Not because it’s trendy. Not because it’s cheap. But because it's honest — when used correctly.</p>

  <h2>The Problem with the News</h2>
  <p>Modern media is saturated with spin. Headlines are twisted for clicks. Stories are told with emotional weight designed to enrage, divide, or manipulate. Truth gets buried beneath agendas, advertising dollars, and partisan tribalism. It's not journalism — it's theater.</p>

  <h2>Why AI Is Different</h2>
  <p>AI doesn’t get angry. It doesn’t have a party. It doesn’t vote. It doesn’t chase ad revenue. Our AI is designed with one purpose: extract the facts, strip the noise, and present the story. That’s it.</p>

  <p>Our custom algorithms rewrite articles to remove political framing, emotional spin, and unverified speculation. You’ll still get the whole story — just not the sensationalized version.</p>

  <h2>Is AI Perfect?</h2>
  <p>No. That’s why <em>we</em> don’t claim to be. But AI is trainable. It’s scalable. And with proper oversight, it’s less biased than any human newsroom. Where humans introduce opinions, our AI introduces consistency. Where media companies bend, we hold the line.</p>

  <h2>Transparency Is Key</h2>
  <p>We show our work. Want to compare how the left and right covered a story? We’ll show you. Want the raw article we rewrote? We’ll link it. You deserve to see how the sausage is made.</p>

  <h2>What’s Coming Next</h2>
  <p>This is just the beginning. Our AI is getting smarter, our systems sharper. In the near future, we’ll be tagging bias, grading trustworthiness, and making news <em>searchable by truth</em>, not traffic.</p>

  <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
  <p>If you're tired of outrage-driven reporting... if you're done with spin… then you're in the right place. No Spin Media is built for people like you. Quiet truth. Loud impact.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>— No Spin Media + AI</strong></p>
